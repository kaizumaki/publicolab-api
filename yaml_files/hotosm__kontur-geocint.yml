    longDescription: Large data processing pipeline running on geocint machine. Geocint
      is Kontur's geodata ETL/CI/CD pipeline designed for ease of maintenance and
      high single-node throughput. Writing the code as Geocint target makes sure that
      it is fully recorded, can be run autonomously, can be inspected, reviewed and
      tested by other team members, and will automatically produce new artifacts once
      new input data comes in.
