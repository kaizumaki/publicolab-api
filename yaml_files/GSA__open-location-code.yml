    longDescription: |
      Open Location Code (OLC) is a library for generating short codes—called plus codes or simply OLC—that encode geographic location.
      Provides an alternative to street addresses in regions without formal addressing.
      Available in multiple programming languages (JavaScript, Python, Java, C++, Go, etc.) via CDNJS and package managers.
      Used globally for emergency response, delivery routing, and humanitarian applications.
