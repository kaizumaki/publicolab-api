      # 倍速会議

      倍速会議 is a web service that visualizes recognition and facilitates consensus building. It collects and analyzes recognition from multiple people on specific themes (e.g., "current status of this project") using LLM-powered insights.

      This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).
