      # TerraVision

      TerraVision is an AI-powered CLI tool that converts Terraform code into Professional Cloud Architecture Diagrams and solves the problem of keeping the most important document in cloud projects, the architecture diagram, up to date. With high velocity releases the norm now, machine generated architecture diagrams are more accurate than relying on the freestyle diagram drawn by the cloud architect that probably doesn't match the reality of what is actually deployed in the cloud anymore.

      TerraVision securely runs 100% Client Side without any dependency or access to your Cloud environment, dynamically parses your conditionally created resources and variables and generates an automatic visual of your architecture. TerraVision is designed to be a 'Docs as Code' (DaC) tool that can be included in your CI/CD pipeline to update architecture diagrams after your build/test/release pipeline phases and supplement other document generators like readthedocs.io alongside it.
